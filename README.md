# HTE-Data-Visualization-in-R
 
This notebook should guide you through generating basic arrayed plots for visualizing 24-well, 96-well, or larger HTE plates. To tell the notebook where the data should go, you will just need to specify a col_no and row_no, as in the basic template. There's also a more complicated template that's also included and will allow you to associate your inputs (reagents, loadings, solvents, etc.) with the results and calculate yield by correction factor against an internal standard. This second spreadsheet will also allow you to filter results by input in R and to plot average results comparitively. 

For other versions of the notebook and Excel template with detailed instructions, visit sites.udel.edu/htecenter

Please let me know if this notebook is helpful! Acknowledgements and/or citations of the Excel template and of pie, bar, or donut plots generated using this notebook are greatly appreciated!
